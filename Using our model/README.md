Demo of how to use our model.

Other pickled (.p) files are the loaded variables required for implementing -- 

A_tilda.rar = contains A_tilda.p, adjacency matrix of our graph

nodes_mapping.p = its a dictionary - {node_name:node_id}. node_name is the actual entity name (eg - "Compound::DB01234") and node_id is it's id in the graph.

DR_model = our pre-trained model
